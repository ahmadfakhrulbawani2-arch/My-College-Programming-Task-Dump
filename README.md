### Let Me Explain
.cph/ = My Competitive Programming Helper: [CPH](https://github.com/agrawal-d/cph) </br>
Or if you use VsCode:
```txt
divyanshuagrawal.competitive-programming-helper
```
code/ = Store C files only
pdf/ = Store PDF problemset
.dat file in Tugas 6_Reading Files = A binary dataset for reading.c

## Compiling & Running Instruction

### Compile & Run C
Make sure you have GNU C compiler installed in your device to run this:

```bash
gcc nama_file.c -o program
./program
```

To read .dat binary file I mention use Hex Editor: [Hex Editor-Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-hexeditor.git)</br>
or if you use VsCode:
```txt
